When you run powertop the first time (or second time), you might see
the following message:

> Loaded 100 prior measurements
> Cannot load from file /var/cache/powertop/saved_parameters.powertop
> File will be loaded after taking minimum number of measurement(s) with battery only

This is not a bug. As the messages shown, you have to run powertop and
wait it to collect enough data in order to create the
saved_parameters.powertop file. Depending on the system, the maximum
requirement is 2250 measurements. The process may take one or two
hours.

Do not rename `/var/cache/powertop/saved_results.powertop to
saved_parameters.powertop.

While this silence the program, it is not correct. The parameters are
models to improve the prediction of power consumption. Try running the
program longer while doing your normal workload.
